## Disclaimer

This project's intend is to serve developers a reliable cors proxy service with fast response for their development.
Using a cors proxy service to connect to your own server is not a best practice.
We'll consistently optimize our service infra to keep the paid version affordable as possible. and the margin will be distributed back to original oss authors.
