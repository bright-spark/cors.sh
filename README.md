## Disclaimer

1. This project's intend is to serve developers a reliable cors proxy service with fast response for their development.
   Using a cors proxy service to connect to your own server is not a best practice.
   We'll consistently optimize our service infra to keep the paid version affordable as possible.

2. The original code behind cors proxy is by Rob wu's cors-anywhere and the playground is forked from hoppscotch. both licensed under MIT, and our project cors.sh is licensed under Apache 2.0.
